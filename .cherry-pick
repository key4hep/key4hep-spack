# Hardcode CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR to lib. This is needed for AlmaLinux 9 where
# CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR gets chosen as lib64 and this causes problems in some
# packages that expect lib. Since spack installs each package to its own prefix
# we don't need to worry about multilib environments

# Because the patch above and py-onnx being a python package, it will try to find
# protobuf in CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR which is lib64 so a symlink is created here
