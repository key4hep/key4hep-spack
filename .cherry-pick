# Hardcode CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR to lib. This is needed for AlmaLinux 9 where
# CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR gets chosen as lib64 and this causes problems in some
# packages that expect lib. Since spack installs each package to its own prefix
# we don't need to worry about multilib environments
# It doesn't seem to do anything at the moment
