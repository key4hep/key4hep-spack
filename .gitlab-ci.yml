variables:

  K4_JOBTYPE: Nightlies
  SPACK_VERSION: ""

stages:
    - compilation
    - deployment


# this job expects the following setup on the runner:
# * environment variables GITHUB_TOKEN and GITHUB_USER

#   set in .bashrc - to be able to query lates commits
# *  (for the nightlies) existing installation of key4hep-stack (stable version) in /cvmfs/sw.hsf.org/spackages
#   (or whatever is defined in upstreams.yaml)
#   this may be read-only - could be delivered by cvmfs
# * writeable directory in /cvmfs/sw-nightlies.hsf.org  / cvmfs/sw.hsf.org
#   (or whatever is defined in config.yaml)

# for the cvmfs deployment:
# * the gitlab-runner user must be able to ssh into the cvmfs publisher
# * the cvmfs publisher must be able to rsync with the build machine



# note that currently the hash of the installed dd4hep is hardcoded
# to avoid rebuilds of everything.
